Simple countdown timer shortcode. Specify date/time, will show YMD... until target.

== Description ==

Provides a shortcode/function to render a countdown timer of the form "Years until target: X, Months until target: Y, Days until target: Z...".
You can specify the date/time of the target, as well as output formats with placeholders (including HTML wrappers) all from within the admin options page.
Display result using the shortcode; you can override global options from within the shortcode too.
By default, result will be something like `"Months 0/Days 0/Years 0; Hours 4:Minutes 59:Seconds 54"`.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip, upload plugin folder to your plugins directory (`/wp-content/plugins/`)
2. Activate plugin
3. Add countdown shortcode anywhere you need it.

Check out the included admin help page for complete explanation within Wordpress!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= What's the shortcode? =

In full glory:

    [countdown_timer
        target_time="2012-05-05 14:03:00"
        complete_text="It's Done!"
        format= {CUSTOM HTML FORMAT - SEE BELOW}
        date_separator='<span class="d-sep">/</span>'
        time_separator='<span class="t-sep">:</span>'
        label_format="<em>%s</em>"
        timezone="America/New_York"
    ]

= Developer Hooks =

The following filters are provided to adjust both the attributes (before rendering) and the format (after rendering).

You would use them like:

    add_filter( 'abt_countdown_timer__pre_render', 'my_countdown_prerender' );
    function my_countdown_prerender($attributes) { ... }

    add_filter( 'abt_countdown_timer__post_render', 'my_countdown_postrender' );
    function my_countdown_postrender($output, $attributes) { ... }

This is how they're used in the plugin:

    // hook - adjust attributes used to render the countdown
    $attributes = apply_filters( 'abt_countdown_timer__pre_render', $attributes );

    // hook - add "before", "after"; alter rendered output
    $formatted_time = apply_filters( 'abt_countdown_timer__post_render', $formatted_time, $attributes );

= Other Options =

* *Title and Link* - tooltip text when hovering over timer; optional link from clicking timer
* *Timezones* - specify a timezone for calculations (if different than WP timezone)
* *Output format* - HTML wrapper for result fields; uses special placeholder formats for label, separators, and time values (see <code>[strftime][]</code>)
* *Date Separator* - text between date values, if used in _Output Format_
* *Time Separator* - text between time values, if used in _Output Format_
* *Interval Label* - wrapper for laber for "Year", "Month", etc
